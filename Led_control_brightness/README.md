1.	Control LED Using Push Button
    Create a simple computer-controlled system so that (push button/switch) digital input sensor is used to control the digital output devices (LEDs) to emulate a simple traffic light control system

2_ Controlling LED Using Photoresistor and Potentionmeter
    Connect LDR/Light Sensor to Arduino analog input A0.
    Connect RGB LED to Arduino PWM pins

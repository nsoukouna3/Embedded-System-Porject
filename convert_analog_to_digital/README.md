1. Connect the 10k potentiometer to analog input A0 of arduino micro-controllers
2. Set baud rate speed to 9600
3. The potentiometer acts as voltage divider circuit between 0V and +5V.
4. The analog voltage from potentiometer is convert to a 10- bit binary number between 00.0000.0000 and 11 1111 1111 byt the analog to digital converter (ADC) circuit in the micro-controller. The corresponding decimal values of the 10-bit binary number in range 0- 1023 are display on serial monitor
connect a resitor and LED to arduino PWM (analog) output pin 9.
